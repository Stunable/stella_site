What is STUNABLE?</p>\r\n\t\tSTUNABLE is your online personal shopper. Everyone here at Stunable.com works night and day, \r\n        leaving no rock unturned in the pursuit of discovering never-before-seen fashion. We pull unique products \r\n        from emerging products, up-and-coming designers and boutiques and put them all in one place: Stunable.com. \r\n       We then sort through this huge collection of clothing, providing you with personalized recommendations based \r\n        on your style and preferences.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">2. What is a Stunner?</p>\r\n\t\tHere at STUNABLE, we believe every woman has her own distinct style. That's why we call everyone that shops with STUNABLE a STUNNER.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">3. How do I find other stunners?</p>\r\n\t\tYou can invite friends to become stunners on STUNABLE by providing their email addresses in the modal \r\n        appearing when \"Invite Stunners\" is clicked. You can search for stunners already using STUNABLE \r\n        by entering their first or last name into the search bar on the left side of the screen. \r\n        If you choose to login to STUNABLE with your Facebook account, your Facebook friends will become accessible as \r\n        stunners and may appear in the \"Happenings\" column on the left side of the screen. \r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">4. How do I share clothes with other stunners?</p>\r\n\t\tYou can share clothes with other stunners by dragging the items you like to the names on the\r\n     left side of the screen. Once you drag a product to a friend, choose to add a note, or just send it along. \r\n         You can also send entire racks within your closet to stunners by dragging that rack to the stunner's name. \r\n         If you don't see the name of the person to whom you're trying to send a trend, simply type their first or \r\n         last name in the search bar above the \"Happenings\" column and your stunners will begin to automatically appear in \r\n         the column as you type their name.\r\n\t\t</div>    \r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">5. What is a closet?</p>\r\n\t\tYour closet is your fashion profile. Adding clothing to your closet allows you easily bookmark items from a\r\n         variety of sources without having to navigate to each individual website or compile a scattered list of\r\n          things you may have liked, but will later fail to remember. You can add clothes to your closet by dragging\r\n           the items you like from the carousel to the closet and racks on the left side of the screen. You can also\r\n            add an item of clothing directly to your closet by clicking the hanger icon underneath the picture of that item.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">6. Who can see my closet?</p>\r\n\t\tThe items and racks within your closet are viewable by other stunners. You can view the clothes and \r\n        racks within your fellow stunner's closets by clicking on their picture. You can add and purchase the clothes\r\n         another stunner has saved to their closet by dragging the item to your closet. Feel free to borrow or \r\n         steal the clothes you like most!\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">7. What is a rack?</p>\r\n\t\tA rack is a category of related clothing. You can add new racks, delete racks and name the racks you have created. \r\n        For example, you might want to create a rack named \u201cworkout wear\u201d and add athletic t-shirts and several pairs \r\n        of yoga pants to it. Or perhaps you want to make a \u201cFriday night out\u201d rack, adding the dresses and tops you are \r\n        thinking about wearing to a party next weekend. You add clothes to a rack by dragging that particular item to the \r\n        rack on the left hand side of the screen.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">8. If add clothes to a rack why do they appear in my closet as well?</p>\r\n\t\tSimilar to the library and playlists found within iTunes, if you add an item to a particular rack, \r\n        it will automatically be added to your closet. On the other hand, if you click the hanger or drag an \r\n        item to the closet, it will be added to the closet, but will not appear on any particular rack. Think of \r\n        it this way: the closet is for collecting, racks are for organizing.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">9. Is there a difference between racks I create and the Recently Added, Purchased and Sale racks?</p>\r\n\t\tYes. While you can add, delete and name racks you create, the purchased, sale, and recently added racks are default\r\n         racks that can't be deleted. The recently added and purchased racks are there to remind you of the latest clothes \r\n         to have been added by you to your closet or purchased on the site. The sale rack will notify you when any of the clothes\r\n          in your closet go on sale! You can purchase entire racks by clicking the \"Buy\" icon next to the name of the rack and share\r\n           racks with others by dragging the rack to the name of a trendsetter- it's all up to you.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">10. How can I improve my recommendations?</p>\r\n\t\tThe more time you spend shopping with Stunable, the more we will get to know your style. Our recommendations \r\n        improve every time you click the thumbs up and thumbs down icons, letting her know which clothes fit your taste.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">11. What happens when I click the Stunable hanger icon?</p>\r\n\t\tThe STUNABLE hanger icon is located underneath a particular item of clothing, whether the item is in the recommendation carousel \r\n        or in a product modal. Clicking the hanger will simply add that article of clothing to your closet.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">12. What shipping options do you offer?</p>\r\n\t\tShipping and handling options are determined by each individual Stunable Stylist and will be displayed during \r\n        the check out process. Stylists must ship products within 7 days of their purchase, but the varying shipping \r\n        policies may extend the period between the purchase and delivery of your product. Expected transit times \r\n        for the most common shipping methods are listed below unless otherwise noted in the seller's policies.\r\n        <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;list-style-position: inside;\">\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Standard U.S.:</span> 4 to 14 business days after shipping (may take up to 21 business days)</li>\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Expedited U.S.:</span> 2 to 6 business days after shipping</li>\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Two-Day U.S.:</span> 2 business days after shipping</li>\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">One-Day U.S.:</span> 1 business day after shipping</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">13. How to do I track my shipment?</p>\r\n\t\tWithin the Order History page of the Manage Account section, you will see a list of your past orders with their \r\n        corresponding icon that says \"Track\". Simply click on the icon, which will re-direct you to a third party shipping \r\n        and handling website responsible for predicting the delivery of you products.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">14. When I track my shipment, it says it has been sent and delivered, but it hasn\u2019t arrived yet. What do I do?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Occasionally a carrier will scan a package as delivered before it arrives at the final destination. \r\n        When this happens, the package is usually delivered within the next few business days.</p>\r\n        <p>If you've waited a couple of days and you still don't have the package:</p>\r\n        <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;list-style-position: inside;\">\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">\r\n                <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">See if someone else accepted delivery </span> \r\n                4 to 14 business days after shipping (may take up to 21 business days)</li>\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">\r\n                <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Look around the delivery location.</span> \r\n                Carriers sometimes leave packages in a safe, hidden place like on a side porch, in/around your garage, or behind bushes.</li>\r\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">\r\n                <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Look for a notice of attempted delivery.</span> \r\n                You may find an attempted delivery notice in your mailbox or P.O.

Do the stylists on STUNABLE ship internationally?</p>\r\n\t\tAt this time, clothing purchased on Stunable.com cannot be mailed to international locations- our stylists only \r\n        ship to the continental U.S. As we grow and expand, Stunable.com will begin to handle foreign transactions \r\n        by implementing a streamlined international shipping policy.\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n        <div class=\"body-content\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"header\">16.

You can select a category of clothing from the tabs or simply view all the products Stunable suggests for you. Stunable will recommend only the clothes that you want to see most, so the complicated process of searching through thousands of products is in her hands! If you see something you like, click the thumbs up to let Stunable know you like what she is sending your way. If something isn&#39;t quite you, click the thumbs down and Stunable will be sure to change up her picks. Customize your browsing experience by changing the sliding scale on the upper right-hand corner of the window and view as little as three or as many as twelve products at time. There are lots of ways to browse&hellip; it&#39;s all up to you! <br>\r\n<center> <img src=\"http://imageshack.us/a/img138/7345/browsing.png\"> </center></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStep 4: Build your closet</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYour closet is your fashion profile. You can add clothes to your closet by dragging the items you like from the carousel to the closet and racks on the left side of the screen. You can also add an item of clothing directly to your closet by clicking the hanger icon underneath the picture of that item. You can view your entire closet by clicking on &quot;your closet&quot; on the left side of the screen. If you want to take a look at your friends&#39; closets, click their name and you will be able to see their entire closet and racks within their closet. Feel free to borrow or steal the clothes you like most!<br>\r\n<center> <img src=\"http://imageshack.us/a/img840/2696/closeth.png\"></center></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStep 5: Organize your closet with racks</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe closet allows you to collect the clothes you like and organize that clothing by creating racks. A rack is a collection of clothing with a common theme chosen by you. You can add new racks, delete racks, and name the racks you have created. For example, you might want to create a rack named &quot;workout wear&quot; and add athletic t-shirts and several pairs of yoga pants to it. Or perhaps you want to make a &quot;Friday night out&quot; rack, adding the dresses and tops you are thinking about wearing to a party next weekend.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou add clothes to a rack by dragging that particular item to the rack on the left hand side of the screen. Similar to the music library and playlists in iTunes, if you add an item to a particular rack, it will automatically be added to your closet. On the other hand, if you click the hanger or drag an item to the closet, it will be added to the closet, but will not appear on any particular rack. <b>Think of it this way: the closet is for collecting, racks are for organizing.</b>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile you can add, delete, and name racks you create, the purchased, sale, and recently added racks are default racks that can&#39;t be deleted. The recently added and purchased racks are there to remind you of the latest items to have been added by you to your closet or purchased on the site. The sale rack will notify you when any item added to your closet goes on sale! You can purchase entire racks and share racks with others&mdash;it&#39;s all up to you.<br>\r\n<center> <img src=\"http://imageshack.us/a/img201/8851/racks.png\"> </center></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStep 6: Share your style</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n                    Here at Stunable, we believe every woman has her own distinct style. That's why we call everyone who Shops with Stella a \r\n                    trendsetter. You can share clothes with other trendsetters by dragging the items you like to the names on the right side of \r\n                    the screen. Find other trendsetters by entering their names in the search bar or simply view your top trendsetters in the \r\n                    \"happenings\" section. Once you drag a product to a friend, choose to add a note, or just send it along.  <br>\r\n<center><img src=\"http://imageshack.us/a/img62/7501/sharex.png\"></center></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStep 7: Wear it</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you want to purchase an item, add it to your cart.

Features include clothing recommendation, customized book marking, and sharing with friends.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn its most basic capacity, Stunable.com is a virtual mall. The application aggregates the clothing of new designers, upcoming brands, boutiques, and small retailers, enabling online shoppers to browse and purchase a wide variety of items on a single user-friendly platform: Stunable.com. The indispensible service of compiling a database of products from diverse clothing vendors is complimented by the application&#39;s recommendation system, which is disguised as a persona known as Stella.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStunable: The Recommendation Engine</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon entering the site, the shopper&#39;s attention is immediately focused on the clothing displayed in Stunable&#39;s recommendation carousel. With its fluid content and ability to scale the size and number of viewable products, the clothing within the carousel are recommendations from Stunable tailored to the personal style of that particular shopper. Stunable&#39;s recommendations are created for each user based on her likes, dislikes, browsing history, purchases, and an ongoing list of user defined questions. The machine-learning algorithm behind the recommender system uses both collaborative filtering and metric space to create predictive recommendations. Scores are calculated using Pearson Correlation and filtering is applied to remove items contrary to a user&#39;s preferences, buying history and personal questions.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tProduct Inventory and Stunable Sync</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStunable.com&#39;s inventory is maintained systematically via Partner Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); or rather what we have dubbed, &quot;Stunable Sync.&quot; Partner APIs communicate directly with the Stunable API, sending product data and images in near real time. &quot;Stunable Sync&quot; also keeps products in near real time sync by using a custom web crawling framework. This framework enables smaller partner organizations without an API to send product data to Stunable. These two fully automated services enable Stunable to act as an all-inclusive online storefront where vast range of products are displayed, shared, and sold.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"title\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStunable API</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe RESTful Stunable API is on the cutting edge of recent developments in technology and works directly with Stunable&#39;s web application code and other API technologies. The API is a key asset to the business, enabling data to be pushed, pulled and updated with other companies and mobile web services. This allows Stunable to both maintain and sell third party inventories while simultaneously updating the master database with recommendation information.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<center><img src='http://imageshack.us/a/img571/2470/stunablesyncdiagram.jpg' border='0'/></center></div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "PRIVACY", "url": "/privacy/", "template_name": "static/privacy-policy.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<div id=\"page-content\" class=\"section clearfix round-corner-shadow\">\r\n    <div class=\"section intro\">\r\n        <h2><span class=\"font-static\">Privacy Policy</span></h2>\r\n    </div><!--/.section.intro-->\r\n    <div class=\"section body-copy\">\r\n        <p>\r\n            Your privacy is very important to us.

Convention on contracts for the international sale of goods. You agree that jurisdiction over and venue in any legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Site (including but not limited to the purchase of Stunable products) shall be in the state or federal courts located in New York. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Site (including but not limited to the purchase of Stunable products) must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. Stunable's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these terms and conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these terms and conditions. Stunable may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.\r\n            Stunable makes no representation that materials in the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where their content is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access this Site from locations outside New York do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the materials in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations. Any claim relating to the materials shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            ARBITRATION.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            By using this Site, you agree that Stunable, at its sole discretion, may require you to submit any disputes arising from the use of this Site, or these Terms and Conditions concerning or, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, nullity, invalidity, non-performance or termination, as well as disputes about filling gaps in this contract or its adaptation to newly arisen circumstances, to final and binding arbitration under the International Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Notwithstanding these rules, however, such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the state as set forth in the previous section. Any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Further, the arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages in any arbitration initiated under this section, except as may be required by statute.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            GENERAL.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Stunable may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting.
